#write a python code to print only those elemnts in a list which are numeric and greater than 6

items=["Sayan","Dhiman","Raja",6,85,99,"Souvik"]
for i in items:
    if str(i).isnumeric()==True and i>6:      #.isnumeric() is a string function. Hence we need to type cast i to string before applying isnumeric() on i.
        print(i)
