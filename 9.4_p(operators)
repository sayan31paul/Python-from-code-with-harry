"""Arithmetic operators"""
# "//"  -> Floor division operator(Simply ignores the part after the decimal)
# "**"  -> Exponential operator
# "%"   -> Returns the remainder

"""Asignment operators"""
# x=5 # "=" is the asignment operator
# x+=7 is same as x=x+7
#  "/="
#  "-="
#  "%="
#Check for other asignment operators in internet

""" Comparision operators"""
# "==" Checks the equality between two numerical values or strings
# ">="
# "<="
# "!="

"""Logical operators"""
# "and"
# "or"

"""Identity operators"""
a=True
b=False
print(a is b)  # "is" is the identity operator
# "is not" is another identity operator

"""Membership operators"""
list=[3,3,2,2,39,35,32,33]
print(32 in list)          # "in" is the membership operator
print(324 in list)
print(324 not in list)     # "not in" is another membership operator

"""Bitwise operator"""
# "&" ->and operator
# "|" ->or operator
print(0 & 1)
print(0 | 1)
