#If we go on doing this with a big file, the file pointer or file handle gets updated every time.
#If we need to know the file pointer is currently in which character we have to use f.tell()
print(f.tell())

#If we want te reset our file pointer to a particular character we have to use f.seek()

#closing the file allows other programs to use the file and also saves resources
