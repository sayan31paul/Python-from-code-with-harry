#Abstraction and Encasulation
"""Imagine you are making a computer. You bought monitor of one company, keyboard from one company, mouse from one
company, cabinet from one company, mother board from one company, hraddisk from another company, etc.
Here monitor, mouse, keyboards, cabinets, hard disk etc are layers of abstraction.
It is even possible that from a particular task, the computer itself is a layer of abstraction. Ex- We are sending
a satellite to mars which contains many computers. Here a computer itself is a layer of abstraction.
We have to do encapsulation to acheive abstraction in object oriented programming.
Encapsulation occurs when the user is using the item but it doesnot know which process is occuring inside the item.
"Aam khai, gutli na gine". """
"""Hiding the technical details of implementation is known as encapsulation."""
